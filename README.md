# AWS_Static_Website
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. This project, deploys a static website to AWS.

First, we create a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. Next, we will upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, we will access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint
